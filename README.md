# NBA_ScoreBoard

As an avid basketball enthusiast, I often struggled to navigate through the games listed on the [NBA official website](https://www.nba.com). To solve this issue, 
I developed an application that simplifies the process of viewing the game scores and upcoming games for the evening. 
Users can easily access this information and stay updated with the latest game scores and schedules.

# How its Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, express, Node.

Using a [GitHub API for the NBA](https://github.com/swar/nba_api), I was able to retrieve real-time data for ongoing games. By leveraging Python, I extracted the data and passed it to a JavaScript file for organization and packaging purposes, ultimately making it ready for the EJS file.
