# NBA_ScoreBoard

As an avid basketball enthusiast, I often struggled to navigate through the games listed on the NBA official website. To solve this issue, 
I developed an application that simplifies the process of viewing the game scores and upcoming games for the evening. 
Users can easily access this information and stay updated with the latest game scores and schedules.
